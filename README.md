# Graphics Programming

## What is this?
This is a project where I was experimenting with programming computer graphics and writing some C++. It never went too far, but I was able to render objects/sprites on the screen via shaders, move them, and change perspectives/projections. I also gained experience using tools such as Valgrind to find memory leaks. Also learned the usefulness of a system like CMake since writing my own makefile for compiling accross different platforms was a pain.
